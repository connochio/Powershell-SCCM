# Powershell-SCCM

In this Repo are some helpful PowerShell scripts and their accompanying mof files for extending the SCCM client hardware inventory.

Instructions on how to use or implement these hardware inventory items are contained within the relevant folders, but these are just suggested implementation procedures. Feel free to use and/or amend them to your own needs if required.
